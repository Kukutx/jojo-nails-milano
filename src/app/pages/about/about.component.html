        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>
          Hackney started as a small interior design firm in downtown Michigan, aiming to help home buyers
          to make do with the new space that they had acquired. It soon became obvious that it would make
          sense to help our clients see beyond the walls and floor plans, and be there with them from the get-go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, we offer house realtor, interior design, and architecture services in order to help our
          customers find their forever homes as seamlessly and painlessly as possible. We value our customers
          above everything else, meaning that we wonâ€™t take "OK" as an answer.
